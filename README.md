## Target Usage
- Mock expensive cloud services, such as 3rd-party login and payment that requires fee and complex round-trip: you call them and then they will call back you later; or even worse - they're one-off
- Mock dependent services for test automation which requires programmatic control
- Share single mock server inside/across team, by specifying rules to separate mocked responses
- Locate performance bottleneck by removing external dependencies 

## Features
- **RESTful API.** Create/update/delete/query mock rules with http test client, for ex. postman, curl, soapui, jmeter, and so on
- **Rule Engine.** dynamically return different response determined by: headers, path, query, body/parameter and so on
- **Web-hook.** Mock callback / notification, such as payment fullfillment 
- **Built-in HTTP(s) proxy.** Backed by [http-proxy](https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy); turn on/off for specific rule
- **Recording Request & Response.** by in-memory sqlite3 database
- **[Simple Web UI] (https://github.com/qiangyt/mock-where-webui)**
